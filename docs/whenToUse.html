<h1>When to use Lightning?</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Lightning can be used in monitoring application's health and availability.</li>
  </ul>
<br>
<h4>When <b>NOT</b> to use</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Lightning only supports HTTP/HEAD in the current version. So please do not consider Lighting in case you want to hit HTTPS or other HTTP verbs like GET, PUT, POST, DELETE.</li>
  <li>Lightning might not be best suited for small number of URLs execution(few hundred or less). Lightning is optimized to handle bulk request therefore execution of few hundres urls would not give you much performance gain.</li>
</ul>
