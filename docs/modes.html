<h1>Modes of Operation</h1>

<section id="embeddedMode" class="subgroup clearfix">
  <h2>Embedded Mode</h2>
  <div>
    <p>In this mode, the Lightning-Core engine is started in memory. The client uses in memory core instance to execute URL.</p>
    <h4>Pros</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Bypass the REST API calls between Lightning client and core, thereby saving network latency and bandwidth.</li>
      <li>Saves management of Lightning-core instances.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Cons</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The core runs in memory thereby ends up consuming JVM resources of the host application.</li>
      <li>The client cannot use more than one core.</li>
      <li>Not scalable horizontally.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>How to Use?</h4>

<section id="standaloneMode" class="subgroup clearfix">
  <h2>Standalone Mode</h2>
  <div>
    <p>In this mode, Lightning-Core instance is started as a standalone process. The client jar is added in the application that wants to use the lightning. The client is built from LightingClientBuilder and is used for various operations.</p>
    <h4>Pros</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Highly Scalable</li>
      <li>Distributed operation</li>
      <li>Fault Tolerant</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Cons</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Need to start and maintain one or more external Lightning-core process(es).</li>
      <li>The lightning client communicates with the core through REST API, thereby costing some network latency and bandwidth.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>How to Use?</h4>
