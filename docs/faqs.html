<p class="question">2. How is Lightning different from other async url executor libraries like asynchttpclient, apache httpClient, etc?</p>
<p>
  Other libraries are great but they are not distributed. Their peak performance is limited to resources available on a single machine. Lightning solves this problem by being distributed URL execution engine. So for scalability just adding more capacity to the core cluster is required.
</p><br>
<p class="question">3. How do I tweak and control various execution parameters?</p>
<p>
  Use LightningClient to update SystemConfig or Submit RequestConfig along with each request. Please take a look at javaDoc of <a target="_blank" href="https://pages.github.corp.ebay.com/Lightning/lightning/apidocs/core/com/ebay/lightning/core/config/RequestConfig.html">RequestConfig</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.corp.ebay.com/Lightning/lightning/apidocs/core/com/ebay/lightning/core/config/SystemConfig.html" target="_blank">SystemConfig</a>.

<br>
<p class="question">4. Does it supports any other languages than Java?</p>
<p>
  Lightning as of now supports only Java.
</p>
<br>
<p class="question">5. I used lightning and URL execution was not fast?</p>
<p>
  Make sure you submit once giving all the url task instead calling submit for each urlTask. Lightning handles queuing and batching internally and it works best if few bulk requests are given instead of multiple small requests.
